# Hyperlocal Air Quality Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict air quality at a hyperlocal scale using synthetic datasets and machine learning models. Hyperlocal air quality prediction focuses on very fine spatial resolutions (e.g., neighborhood or street level), which is important for personalized health advisories and urban planning.

The repository contains three main parts:
- **Project Proposal:** Outlines the objectives, motivation, and approach.
- **Literature Review:** Summarizes relevant research on hyperlocal air quality monitoring and AI methods.
- **Python Code:** Generates synthetic air quality data, performs exploratory data analysis, trains a machine learning model, and evaluates its performance.

## Features

- Synthetic dataset generation simulating temperature, humidity, wind speed, time, and location.
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
- Random Forest regression model to predict Air Quality Index (AQI).
- Model evaluation and feature importance analysis.
